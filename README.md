# MPI Based Matrix Operation Algorithms for Parallel Computing Experiments

These algoritms are primarily used to measure performance, i.e. running time, of various parallel computing environments (multi-cores, multi-nodes, etc.). The `N` matrix dimensions can be defined, while ommiting the content of the matrices themselves.

## Environment Assumptions

These algorithms are developed with the following assumptions:

### Multi-nodes environment

- Using (up to) 8 nodes slurm environment with hostname: `node-01`, `node-02`, ..., `node-08`
- Round-robin distributed in core-first manner instead of node-first

### üìÇ conjugate-gradient

Matrix x vector equation solver with [Conjugate gradient method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method).

#### Definition

Suppose we want to solve the system of linear equations

$$
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} \mathbf {x} =\mathbf {b} }
$$

for the vector ${\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }$, where the known ${\displaystyle n\times n}$ matrix ${\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }$ is symmetric (i.e., ${\displaystyle \mathbf {A}^\mathbf{T} =\mathbf{A}}$), positive-definite (i.e. ${\displaystyle \mathbf{x}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} > 0}$ for all non-zero vectors ${\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }$ in ${\displaystyle \mathbf{R}^\mathbf{n}}$), and real, and ${\displaystyle \mathbf {b} }$ is known as well. We denote the unique solution of this system by ${\displaystyle \mathbf {x} _{\\*}}$.

### üìÇ cannon

[Cannon's distributed algorithm for matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon%27s_algorithm)

> When multiplying two n√ón matrices A and B, we need n√ón processing nodes p arranged in a 2D grid.

```
// PE(i , j)
k := (i + j) mod N;
a := a[i][k];
b := b[k][j];
c[i][j] := 0;
for (l := 0; l < N; l++) {
    c[i][j] := c[i][j] + a * b;
        concurrently {
            send a to PE(i, (j + N ‚àí 1) mod N);
            send b to PE((i + N ‚àí 1) mod N, j);
        } with {
            receive a' from PE(i, (j + 1) mod N);
            receive b' from PE((i + 1) mod N, j );
        }
    a := a';
    b := b';
}
```
